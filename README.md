# GenericSPRI
One of the challenges in laboratory automation is standardising methods to a validated framework. Without a comprehensive framework, new methods proliferate and expand the remit of automation teams. These methods are functionally identical, with only slight differences in pipetting volumes or mix cycles. 

We're excited to introduce Generic_SPRI_CleanUp, a modular Hamilton method able to perform a wide range of bead-based purification steps. This is the Wellcome Sanger Institite's first attempt at standardising a collection of functionally identical but distinct Hamilton methods into one unified, validated method.

### Features
- **Easy Version Control**: By using this method for all clean-ups, it's easy to update methods and ensure every instrument is running the lasest version
- **Pipeline Specificity**: The details of each pipeline run are contained within a JSON file, ensuring each run has the correct parameters for the samples it is processing.
